# the rules of the game

you are on the blue team, and your goal is to take out the three red towers on the opposite side of the screen. but *be careful* - it's going to take a lot of energy
and manpower to take them down. 

you can drag and drop fighters onto the screen, but each fighter requires a certain amount of energy. 

the amount of energy you currently have can be seen at the bottom of the screen (it's a purple bar). if you don't have enough energy, you can't use fighters,
and they'll bounce right back when you try to place them on the screen. 

*in order to win the game, you must take out all three of the red towers before they take out yours!*

# the different fighters

there are three possible fighters that you can use -- each of which has a different level of strength and a different amount of energy needed to be used. 

***fighter 1***: the weakest fighter has a red hat and brown clothing. it costs ***two*** energy bars and can only survive ***10*** hits. 

***fighter 2***: this fighter is wearing a red & blue shirt with brown pants. it costs ***4*** energy bars and can survive ***30*** hits. 

***fighter 3***: this is the strongest fighter -- it has a huge helmet on its head and is significantly larger than the others. it costs ***6*** energy bars and 
can survive ***90*** hits.

# something to note

while you have the ability to create fighters, so does the opposing team (aka the computer). fighters from opposing teams are automatically attracted to each other,
and they will fight others in their path on the way to the towers.

# about the creator

hi there! i'm aashna, a current student at UC Berkeley studying computer science. i created this game in my junior year of high school in an effort to explore 
game development and continue to develop my java skills. beyond just writing the code, i also designed all of the characters, animations, and background images. 
i hope you enjoy playing :)
