<h1><strong><span style="color: #33cccc;">Hey there! Want to know how to play my game,</span> <span style="color: #993366;">Clash Royale?</span></strong></h1>
<h2><span style="color: #ff99cc;">Some things to know:</span></h2>
<p>- Any players on your side are wearing <span style="color: #0000ff;">blue</span>. Any players on the opposite side are wearing <span style="color: #ff6600;">red</span>.</p>
<p>- Your goal is to take out the three <span style="color: #ff6600;">red</span> towers on the opposite side of the screen. But be careful! It's going to take a lot of energy and manpower to take them down.</p>
<p>- You can drag and drop fighters onto the screen. Each fighter requires a certain amount of energy.</p>
<p>- The amount of energy you currently have can be seen at the very bottom. It's the <span style="color: #993366;">purple</span> bar. If you don't have enough energy, you can't use fighters and they'll bounce right back when you try to place them onto the screen.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff99cc;">How to win:&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p>- If you take out all three of the red towers, you'll win the game!</p>
